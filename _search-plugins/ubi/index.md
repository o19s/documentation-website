# Overview
User Behavior Insights, or UBI, is a community plugin for capturing client-side events and queries for the purposes of improving search relevance and user experience.
It is a causal system, linking a user's query to all subsequent user interactions with your application until they perform another search.



* An OpenSearch [plugin](https://github.com/o19s/opensearch-ubi) that facilitates the storage of client-side events and queries.
* A client-side JavaScript library reference implementation that shows how to capture events and send those events to the OpenSearch UBI plugin.
