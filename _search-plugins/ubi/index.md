User Behavior Insights (UBI) is a plugin that captures client-side events and queries for the purposes of improving search relevance and user experience.
It is a causal system, linking a user's query to all subsequent user interactions with your application until the user performs another search.

UBI includes the following elements:
* A machine-readable [schema](https://github.com/o19s/ubi) that faciliates interoperablity of the UBI specification.
* An OpenSearch [plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/user-behavior-insights) that facilitates the storage of client-side events and queries.
* A client-side JavaScript [example reference implementation]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/ubi/data-structures/) that shows how to capture events and send those events to the OpenSearch UBI plugin.
